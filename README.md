# AREA
![maintenance-status](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintenance-as--is-yellow.svg)


The AREA is a 3rd year project consisting in building a multi-platform dashboard-style app allowing users to create automations just like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).

In order to do so, students must gather feeds from multiple external APIs and centralize them to all users.

Beware, this project was done in late 2022 and APIs change are happening regularly. This project is therefore deprecated and no maintenance will take place.

## Code base
<strong>The project is organized in three parts:</strong>
1. The mobile front-end is located under `mobile/`
2. The desktop/web front-end is located under `desktop/`
3. The back-end is located under `api/`
